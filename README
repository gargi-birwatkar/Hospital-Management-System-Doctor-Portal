🏥 Hospital Management System – Doctor Portal

A desktop-based **Hospital Management System (Doctor Portal)** built using **Java (Swing)** and **MySQL**.
The system allows doctors to manage their **profiles**, view/edit **appointments**, and upload/manage **research papers** — all in one place.
Uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts throughout the architecture.

## 📦 Folder Structure

```
HospitalManagementSystem/
   ├── DoctorPortalProject/     (your netbeans project)
   ├── doctor database (your exported DB file)
        └─gargi.sql   
   ├──  README.md                (Documentation)
```

 🗄️ Database (MySQL)

The database export file is included inside:

**/database/hospital.sql**

It contains the following:

* Doctor table
* Patient table
* Appointment table
* Research table
* Sample doctor/patient data

No MySQL username/password is included → **safe for GitHub**.
Update dbconfig.properties

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

### **1. Import MySQL Database**

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Create a new database:

   ```
   CREATE DATABASE gargi;
   ```
3. Import the file **doctor database.sql** from the project folder

---

### **2. Update DB Connection in Java**

In your `DBConnection.java`:

```java- dbconfig.properties
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gargi";
String user = "root";         // Change to your MySQL username
String password = "";         // Enter your MySQL password
```

---

### **3. Run the Program**

1. Open NetBeans
2. Select **Open Project**
3. Choose the project folder
4. Make sure `mysql-connector.jar` is added in Libraries
5. Run the main class in dashboad/login_doc.java

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

* **Encapsulation** – private variables + getters/setters
* **Abstraction** – separate UI, model, and database classes
* **Inheritance** – base user/doctor classes reused
* **Polymorphism** – overridden functions for data display and loading

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Add patient login portal
* Add admin dashboard
* Implement online appointment system
* Real-time notifications for new appointments
